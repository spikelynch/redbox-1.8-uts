The rig consists of a 4.9 metre wave tank with a paddle wheel at one end which generates propagating waves. The   tank features a beach that is overtopped by the waves to prevent wave refection. This means there is a constant source of waves. The water   that overtops the beach is pumped back into the tank to maintain the water level. </description><service>Labshare.service.1</service><projectnumber>2010002365</projectnumber><group>FEIT.School of Computing and Communications</group><share>Y</share><supervisor>890530</supervisor><title>UTS FEIT Wavetank Characterisation dataset</title></metadata>
